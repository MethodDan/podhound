# podhound podcast manager

PROJECT STATUS: Barely started -- as of 30/05/2018

This is just a hobby project to create a simple podcast manager with web UI.
It may not come to much but my goal is to make a web app for hosting on your own server.
To do this I am using Python3 and Django. 

The project was developed on an Ubuntu server but should work anywhere you have Django working.

The intention is to make it possible to:
- View and manage your subscribed podcast feeds
- Organise shows into categories
- Update feeds and download new files at set intervals
- See episode status. e.g listened/unlistened
- Record basic ratings per listner
- Add new feeds by URL
- Import multiple feeds at once with an OPML file
- See which episodes are new and unlistened in a dashboard
- Search shows and episodes by text

Can't guarentee any or all of these features will appear or work properly. 

At the moment I have a whole lot of good intentions and not a whole lot of anything else.

Obviously this project is strictly USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
