# podhurd
Just a hobby Django project to create a simple podcast manager with web UI.
It may not come to much but my goal is to make a web app for hosting on your own server.
To do this I am using Python3 and Django. 

The project was developed on an Ubuntu server but should work anywhere you have Django working.

The intention is to make it possible to:
- View your subscribed podcasts
- See episode status = listened/unlistened etc
- Add new feeds by URL
- Import multiple feeds at once with an OPML file
- See which episodes are new and unlistened in a dashboard

PROJECT STATUS: barely started as of May 30th 2018 but have good intentions.
